## Peer Review Project Markdown File.
This is a _markdown_ file.
A *markdown* file is a text file written with the markdown syntax. It may have a .md extension.
Markdown is a **markup** language. It is designed such that it converted to other formats easily.
It is used to create readme/meta files. Such files are useful for the instruction or information they give about other files or objects.

### Advantages of Markdown
1. Easy syntax
2. Easily convertible
* NB: I am still a beginner but I can testify that it is relatively easy and straightforward to use
+ This is testing unordered lists
- Another point

### Other things that can be done
> Blockquote like this

Code Blocks
``` javascript
var x
```
`A code block `
Tables

| Tables | and | The likes|
